Convoluted neural networks provide the best performance under the following conditions:
Specialized nets for specific tasks, for example a specialist predicts the position of the nose tip.
Learning rate and momentum linearly dependent on the epochs
Regularization techniques

This work must be seen as an introduction to neural networks, i.e. no extensive research on optimization of parameters.
